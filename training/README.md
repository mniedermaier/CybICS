# Training 
This section provides an overview of the training modules available for the CybICS testbed.
These modules are designed to offer a foundational understanding and practical experience with the testbed's capabilities.
While they serve as an excellent starting point for your training journey, it is important to note that they are not exhaustive and may not cover every aspect of the system in detail.

You have the flexibility to complete the training modules in any sequence that best suits your needs and interests.
However, to maximize your learning and ensure a structured approach, we recommend following the suggested order.
This recommended sequence is designed to build your knowledge progressively, laying a solid groundwork before advancing to more complex topics.
