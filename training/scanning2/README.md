# üìñ How to Scan S7 Communication (S7comm) with Nmap and `s7-info` NSE

### **üîç Introduction**
Siemens **S7 Communication (S7comm)** operates on **port 102** and is used for **communication between Siemens PLCs and industrial automation systems**. Nmap provides an **NSE script (`s7-info`)** to scan for and retrieve information from **S7 PLCs**.

---

### **‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites**
Before scanning, ensure you have:
1. **Nmap Installed**  
   - On Debian-based systems (Ubuntu, Kali, etc.):
     ```bash
     sudo apt update && sudo apt install nmap -y
     ```
   - On RedHat-based systems (CentOS, Fedora, etc.):
     ```bash
     sudo yum install nmap -y
     ```
   - On Windows, download it from [Nmap's official site](https://nmap.org/download.html).

2. **Siemens PLC or S7-compatible device running on port 102**  
   - Ensure the **target device** has **port 102 open**.

3. **Permissions**  
   - Root or administrator access may be required.

### **üîí Security Considerations**
Only scan authorized devices! Unauthorized scanning may violate network security policies.
Avoid scanning production systems during working hours to prevent disruptions.
Use a VPN or secure network when scanning remote devices.

---

### **üõ†Ô∏è Running the Scan**
To scan for **Siemens S7 PLCs**, use the following **Nmap command**:

```bash
nmap -p 102 --script s7-info $DEVICE_IP
```
