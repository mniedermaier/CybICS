# üè≠ PLC Programming Guide

## üìã Overview
This module introduces the concept of programming the PLC in the CybICS testbed.

## üõ†Ô∏è OpenPLC Editor
OpenPLC Editor is a powerful, open-source tool designed for programming and configuring PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) using the IEC 61131-3 standard.
It provides a user-friendly interface for creating and managing control logic in various programming languages, such as Ladder Diagram (LD), Structured Text (ST), and Function Block Diagram (FBD).

With OpenPLC Editor, users can design and simulate control processes, making it easier to develop and test automation systems before deployment.
The editor supports real-time monitoring and debugging, allowing engineers to troubleshoot and refine their control logic efficiently.
Its compatibility with multiple PLC hardware platforms and its open-source nature make it a versatile and accessible option for both professionals and hobbyists in industrial automation.

## üì• Installation

### üîß Setup Steps
1. Clone the repository of the OpenPLC editor:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/thiagoralves/OpenPLC_Editor
   ```

2. Change into the folder of the OpenPLC editor:
   ```sh
   cd OpenPLC_Editor/
   ```

3. Start the installation script:
   ```sh
   ./install.sh
   ```

4. To start the OpenPLC editor:
   ```sh
   ./openplc_editor.sh
   ```

## üíª Using the Editor
1. Open the project called "software" in this folder
2. Start making changes to the program

## üîÑ Program Overview
The CybICS program manages the operation of an industrial system by controlling components like a compressor, system valve, and various signals based on input conditions and internal states.
It includes logic for automatic mode operation, with specific rules for refilling a tank, controlling a compressor, and adjusting outputs.
The program also manages a heartbeat signal and handles system stop conditions by deactivating components.
The countHeartbeat variable is used for timing purposes, and the program is configured to run periodically in the PLC environment.

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Uploading the Program
Upload the program to the OpenPLC via the web interface on port 8080.
Do not forget to delete the previous CybICS ST code.
